    <h1>Caramelized Baked Chicken</h1>
    
<h2>Description: </h2>
<img src="https://simply-delicious-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Coconut-caramel-chicken-2-2.jpg" alt="chiken-on a plate"/>
<p>Caramelized baked chicken wings are marinated and cooked in a flavorful sauce made of brown sugar, soy sauce and butter. They are tender, succulent and easy to make.</p>

<p>How do I even begin to describe the amazingness of this meal? The sauce. Oh my goodness. It is a sweet caramelized teriyaki glaze. Not to mention, the chicken is cooked in the skillet to juicy, tenderized perfection. The skillet gave it the perfect golden-brown crust along the outside. This is a one-pot recipe you’ll want to make again and again! My kids are always asking for it, and for good reason! It’s hard to resist something so saucy and bursting with flavor.</p>
