Easy Crepes Couldn't Be Simpler
by Delish US

Crepes are probably our favorite quick and easy sweet breakfast treat. They come together faster than pancakes or waffles, and unlike those two other breakfast treats, crepes are begging to be topped with more than just maple syrup. Fruit, nutella, gruyere cheese and mushroom gravy are just some of the amazing topping options at your finger tips.  </p>

    The secret to perfect crepes? Let the batter rest at least 20 minutes at room temperature (an hour or more in the refrigerator is even better!) This allows the flour to absorb the liquid and gives the gluten a chance to relax so your crepes will be tender instead of chewy. Read on for more tips and tricks on how to make the perfect crepes
   </p>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  
  <ul>
      <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
      <li> 2 eggs </li>
      <li> ½ cup milk </li>
      <li>  ½ cup water </li>
      <li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted </li>

  </ul>


<h2>Steps:</h2>



<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
    </li>
    <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
