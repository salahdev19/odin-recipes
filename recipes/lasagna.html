     <h2>Description:</h2>
       <p>
        If you’re like us, you can eat lasagna all the time! A warm and cheesy lasagna dish is an ideal go-to meal for family gatherings and celebrations. When topped with grated fresh parmesan cheese and a glass of pinot noir, a regular lasagna dish on a Friday night is elevated to a gourmet meal fit for a king and queen. That’s exactly the kind of experience you’ll enjoy at Mi’talia, the best lasagna restaurant in Miami. When you’re here, you’ll want to try our Stone Oven Lasagna made with beef bolognese and paired with sourdough toast. But as much as we eat and love this Italian favorite, have you ever wondered who invented lasagna? </p>

            <p>
            Lasagne is the plural word for one sheet of lasagna and is used regionally throughout Italy. Referencing lasagne or lasagna depends on whether you’re in the northern or southern regions of Italy. The plural form is mostly used in British English, while American English is known to use the singular version. </p>
